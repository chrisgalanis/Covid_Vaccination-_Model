# Covid_Vaccination-_Model

In quarantine time, I was curious how much the daily vaccination rate, that was presented in the Greek Government Health Website, was impacting the national immunity for quarantine to end. The researchers then were stating that a 70-90% of the population, was needed to bevaccinated was achieve "Herd Immunity". So, me and my friend created a Python Model, that arithmetically solved a differential equation, with 3 functions based on the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model and the daily data that we extracted from the Governmentâ€™s Website!

Folders:

- CovidAlgo: Includes the first version that only includes the real data and printed in graphs.
- SIRV Model: Includes the the Euler Algorithms for the prediction and prints the theoretical graphs
- SIRV-Model: Final Version, includes both read data and Theoretical in the same graph.
